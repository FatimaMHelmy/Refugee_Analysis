In this visualization project, we wanted to address the problem of refugees.

Every single day, families around the world are being forced from their homes. 
In search of safety and a better life, they are risking everything to escape conflict, 
disaster, poverty, or hunger, often leaving with nothing but the clothes they are wearing.

## Different Types

It’s crucial today to understand what an asylum seeker, IDP or a refugee is because of all the misconceptions and misunderstandings around those terms.

### Refugees
Refugees are people who have fled their homes, crossed an international border, and cannot return because they fear their lives are in danger. People become refugees when one or more of their basic human rights are violated or threatened.

### IDPs
IDPs have been forced to flee their homes for the same reasons as refugees but have not crossed an international border. IDPs live in their countries of origin but are often afraid or unwilling to return home for fear of persecution.

### Asylum-seekers
Asylum-seekers are people who have fled their homes and claim international protection, but whose status has not yet been definitively determined. Every refugee begins as an asylum-seeker, but not every asylum-seeker will be granted refugee status.
